# 📊 Social Media & Mental Health Balance Analysis
A data analysis project with statistical modeling foundations for future data science work.


## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes how social media screen time interacts with lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, stress levels, and exercise frequency to influence happiness. While rooted in exploratory data analysis 
and business reasoning, the project gradually extends into statistical modeling, reflecting a Data Analyst skill set with a clear pathway toward Data Scientist responsibilities.


## 🧠 Business & Analytical Questions
* How does daily screen time relate to happiness across users?
* Which lifestyle factors buffer or amplify the emotional impact of screen exposure?
* Can behavioral patterns help distinguish balanced vs high-risk digital habits?
* How can these insights inform mental health and digital well-being initiatives?


## 🛠 Methodology (Analyst → Scientist Progression)
* Data cleaning and validation using domain-based reasoning
* Descriptive and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Interaction analysis to study behavioral moderation effects
* Multiple linear regression with interaction terms
* Model diagnostics (VIF, residual analysis) to validate assumptions


## 📈 Key Insights
* Screen time alone is not a strong determinant of happiness.
* Sleep quality and stress levels significantly shape the emotional impact of digital usage.
* Exercise contributes to resilience under high screen exposure.
* Well-being outcomes emerge from interacting behaviors, not isolated variables.


## ✅ Practical Takeaways
* Digital well-being strategies should focus on sleep and stress management rather than strict screen-time limits.
* Physical activity plays a meaningful supporting role for high screen-time individuals.
* Balanced lifestyle frameworks are more effective than digital abstinence.


## ⚠️ Limitations
* Cross-sectional and self-reported data
* No causal inference
* Potential confounding variables not captured


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels


## 🚀 Career Positioning
This project reflects my current focus as a Data Analyst, with an emphasis on data cleaning, EDA, interpretation, and communication. The inclusion of interaction modeling and diagnostics demonstrates my ongoing 
progression toward Data Scientist responsibilities, including statistical reasoning and model validation.


## 📌 Conclusion
By combining analytical rigor with behavioral insight, this project highlights how thoughtful data analysis can evolve naturally into data science work when grounded in strong exploratory foundations.
